						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						Musical Instrument Identification by a computer has many scientific as well as practical applications such as automatic annotation of musical data, structured coding and ultimately developing a system that can understand music 
					enough to collaborate with a human in real-time performance.The goal of this project is to identify musical instruments from their audio samples using a statistical pattern-recognition technique.

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						There are many scientific and practical applications in which musical instrument identification by  a computer would be useful.  Some of them are :
						<ul>
							<li>Automatically annotating musical multimedia data</li>
							<li>Transcribing musical performances for purposes of teaching, theoretical study, or structured coding</li>
							<li>Ultimately, developing a system that can understand music enough to collaborate with a human in real-time performance</li>
						</ul>
						By attempting to build such systems, we stand to learn a great deal about the human system we seek to emulate.

						Why do different musical instruments have different sounds?<br>
Various characteristics of sound, such as loudness (related to energy) and pitch (related to frequency) determine how our brain perceives a musical instrument.
BUT, if a clarinet and a piano play notes of the same pitch and loudness, the sounds will still be quite distinct to our ears.  
What , then , discriminates the sound of a clarinet from a piano ?<br><br>

The answer is Timbre!<br>
Timbre distinguishes different types of  musical instruments, such as string instruments, wind instruments, and percussion instruments. It also enables listeners to distinguish different instruments in the same category (e.g.  a clarinet and an oboe) .<br>
Musical instruments do not vibrate at a single frequency: a given note involves vibrations at many different frequencies, often called harmonics,  partials, or overtones. The relative pitch and loudness of these overtones along with other acoustic features give the note a characteristic sound we call the timbre of the instrument.<br><br>

Timbre can be successfully used to distinguish between the 4 broad classes of music. After that we may use class-specific features to distinguish the intrument within the class.<br><br>

Thus to achieve the goal of detecting the instrument bein played in a given sound clip, we propose a two step approach: <br>
[1] In the first step we take advantage of the fact that musical instruments can be divided into 4 broad classes: Woodwind; String; Keyboard; Brass. Thus we train use a simple multilayer perceptron trained using basic timbre features : Spectral Centroid, Zero Crossing rate and Spectral Rolloff. This helps find the basic class of the given musical instrument and leaves us with the task of finding the exact instrument from within that basic class.<br>
[2] In the second step, we train a classifer with individual class specific features as mentioned below. This helps us to accuarately identify the musical intrument within the basic class as detected earlier.<br>

						<br>The dataset chosen for the task at hand is the audio samples taken from the University of Iowa - Electronic Music Studies .
						The samples taken belong to the three instrument families namely - String , Woodwind and Brass. There are a total of
						417 samples of which a 80 % - 20 % division have been done to be used for training and testing, respectively.<br>
